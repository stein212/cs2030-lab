<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>
The Kent Ridge Cruise Centre has just opened and you are required to design a program to decide how many loaders to buy based on a single-day cruise schedule.
</p>
<h3>Loaders</h3>
<p>
Loaders have to be  purchased to serve cruises. Each loader will serve a cruise as soon as it arrives, and continues to do so until the service time has elapsed..
</p>
<p>
While the loaders are in the midst of serving a cruise, they cannot serve another cruise.
</p>
<p>
For example, if an incoming cruise arrives at 12PM, requires two loaders, and 60 min for it to be fully served, then,
at 12PM, there must be two vacant loaders.  These two loaders will serve the cruise from 12PM - 1PM.  They can only serve another cruise from 1PM onwards.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Cruises</h3>
<p>
All cruises have four attributes: a unique identifier, and a time of arrival, the time needed to serve the cruise (in minutes) and the number of loaders needed to serve the cruise.
</p>
<p>
The unique identifier is a String, for example, S1234. The time of arrival comes in HHMM format, such as 2359, denoting that the cruise has arrived at 11:59PM on that day.
</p>
<p>
Every cruise must be served by loaders immediately upon arrival. There are two types of cruises:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><code>SmallCruise</code>:</li>
	<ul>
        <li><code>SmallCruise</code>s have an identifier that starts with a character 'S' (case sensitive).  </li>
		<li>Takes a fixed 30min for a loader to fully load.</li>
		<li>Requires only one loader for it to be fully served.</li>
		<li>A schedule entry is read as such:
			<pre>S1234 0000</pre>
denoting that cruise S1234 arrives at 12AM, requires 1 loader and 30 minutes to be fully served.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<li><code>BigCruise</code>:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><code>BigCruise</code>s have an identifier that starts with the character 'B' (case-sensitive). Furthermore, they have a variable number of loaders and time required to serve it.</li>
		<li>Takes one minute to serve every 50 passengers.</li>
		<li>Requires one loader per every 40 meters in length of the cruise (or part thereof)  to fully load,</li>
		<li>A schedule entry is read as such:<br>
			<pre>B1234 0000 200 3720</pre>
denoting that cruise B1234 arrives at 12AM, has a length of 200 meters, with 3720 passengers.  
This cruise requires ceil(200/40) = 5 loaders and takes ceil(3720/50) = 75 minutes to be fully served.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The program determines the number of loaders and the allocation schedule using the following steps:
<ul>
	<li>For each cruise, check through the inventory of loaders, starting from the loader first purchased and so on.</li>
	<li>The first (or first few) loaders available will be used to serve the cruise.</li>
	<li>If there are not enough loaders, purchase a new one(s), and that loader(s) will be used to serve the cruise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
Write a program that reads in the number of cruises in the schedule as an integer, and a list of cruises that will arrive for that day.
</p>
<p>
The program will output the loader allocation schedule.
Take note of the following assumptions:
<ul>
	<li>Input cruises are presented chronologically by arrival time.</li>
	<li>There can be up to 30 cruises in one day.</li>
    <li>The number of loaders servicing a cruise will not exceed 9.</li>
	<li>There are no duplicates in the input cruises.</li>
	<li>All cruises will arrive and be completely served within a single day.</li>
	<li>Input validation is not required and all inputs are assumed to be correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although this problem can be implemented procedurally, you are to model your solution using an object-oriented approach instead.
This task is divided into five levels. You need to complete ALL levels.
</p>
<table border=1 width=800 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h2>Represent a Cruise</h2>
<p>
Design an <em>immutable</em> class <code>Cruise</code> that represents a <code>Cruise</code> instance, with a unique identifier string, the time of arrival as an integer, the number of loaders required to load the cruise as an integer, and the service time in minutes as an integer.
</p>
<p>
Note that the time of arrival is in HHMM format. Specifically, 0 or 0000 refers to 00:00 (12AM), 30 or 0030 refers to 00:30 (12:30AM), and 130 or 0130 refers to 01:30 (1:30AM).
</p>
<p>
Implement a <code>getServiceCompletionTime</code> method, which returns the time (in minutes) the service is completed since the start of time 0, and a <code>getArrivalTime</code> method, which returns the arrival time in minutes since the start of the time 0.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the <code>Cruise</code> arrives at 12PM, the arrival time is (12 * 60) = 720; the service completion time is 12:30PM, which is 750 minutes from 00:00. (12 * 60) + 30 = 750). 
</p>
<p>
In addition, implement a <code>getNumOfLoadersRequired</code> method, which returns the number of loaders required to load the cruise.
</p>
<p>
A string representation of a cruise is in the form:
<pre>
cruiseID@HHMM
</pre>
The <code>%0Xd</code> format specifier might be of use to you, where the integer will be represented by an X-digit zero-padded number.
</p>
For instance,
<pre>
String.format("%04d", 20);
</pre>		
would return <code>0020</code>.
<pre>
jshell> /open Cruise.java
jshell> new Cruise("A1234", 0, 2, 30)
$.. ==> A1234@0000
jshell> new Cruise("A2345", 30, 2, 30)
$.. ==> A2345@0030
jshell> new Cruise("A3456", 130, 2, 30)
$.. ==> A3456@0130
jshell> new Cruise("A3456", 130, 2, 30).getArrivalTime()
$.. ==> 90
jshell> new Cruise("A3456", 130, 2, 30).getNumOfLoadersRequired()
$.. ==> 2
jshell> new Cruise("A3456", 130, 5, 30).getNumOfLoadersRequired()

jshell> new Cruise("A1234", 0, 2, 30).getServiceCompletionTime()
$.. ==> 30
jshell> new Cruise("A1234", 0, 2, 45).getServiceCompletionTime()
$.. ==> 45
jshell> new Cruise("CS2030", 1200, 2, 100).getServiceCompletionTime()
$.. ==> 820
jshell> new Cruise("D1010", 2329, 2, 30).getServiceCompletionTime()
$.. ==> 1439
jshell> /exit

<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h2>Use Loaders to serve Cruises</h2>
<p>
Design a <em>immutable</em> class <code>Loader</code> that is able to serve a <code>Cruise</code> using a <code>serve(Cruise)</code> method. Add a <code>canServe(Cruise)</code> method that returns a boolean value to check if a given loader is available to serve the given cruise.  Note the following:
<ul>
	<li>The constructor takes in an integer denoting its ID.  </li>
	<li><code>Loader</code> instances are immutable.</li>
	<li>If the <code>loader</code> cannot serve a cruise, a <code>null</code> value is returned.</li>
</ul>
The string representation of each Loader is in the form:
<pre>
Loader id serving cruiseid@cruisearrivaltime
</pre>
if the loader is serving a cruise, or simply
<pre>
Loader id 
</pre>
if the loader is not serving any cruise.

<h2>Level 5</h2>
<h2>Completing the program</h2>
<p>
Write a program that reads in the number of cruises that arrive daily, and the daily cruise schedule.
Then, print out the allocation schedule for the loaders.
Bear in mind that there can be up to 30 cruises in one day, and 
the number of loaders servicing a cruise will not exceed 9.
</p>

<p>
By including the functionality of input and output, compile and run the program as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$ javac Main.java
</pre>
<p>
where the Main class, together with all its dependency classes will be compiled. Then
</p>
<pre>
$ java Main
